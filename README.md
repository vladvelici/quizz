Quizz
=====

> This is a work in progress.

Go web app (for appengine) to aid learning and remembering by answering and creating questions.

Planned features
----------------

This is a very high-level and vague description of this project.

- Add / Edit / Delete questions
- Add / Edit / Delete topics (tags)
- Take a quiz (automatically generated from tags/topics, following questions and questions previously answered)
- Quizz will ask questions that you often get WRONG, but will try to avoid repetition as well
- Tags can be: uni module codes, general topics, etc. Each question has more tags.

=====If all goes well...

... these kind of things will be considered:

- **smart numerical questions**. Author a question once, with variables instaed of numbers, and Quizz generates instances of it in respect to some equations that need to be satisfied.
- **non-extact text matching**. Apply some sort of stemming on answers for better free-text answer matching.
- **related resources**. Each question will have the option to add related resources, where users can read more about the topic in order to answer the question.
- **many more...** and suggestions are welcome!
